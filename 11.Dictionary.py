         # Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
    # A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

    # In dictionary the key is always written in string not in integer

# thisdict = {
#   "brand": "Ford",
#   "model": "Mustang",
#   "year": 1964
# }
# print(thisdict)



        # The indexing of dictionary is done in reverse order when compare with any other 
         # 2D data structure 

    # Every column in dictionary represents the independent list 
     # The data type of column is decided by the value having highest precedance 
     # datatype


    # If we try to add the new column in dictornary wiht existing name then
     # instead of adding new column the old values will be overrideen
