            # strings are combination of characters in python which means that they can be access
            # using the index number just like list also slicing is possible with same set of rules


            # just like Java strings in python are  immutable meaning that string once created can not be 
            # updated further if in case it is requried then it can be done using 
            # concatination, slicing or formating
 
            # del keyword is used to delete string instance


# m1 = "Hello Girl"
# m2 = m1.replace("Girl","Gurl")
# print(m2)
