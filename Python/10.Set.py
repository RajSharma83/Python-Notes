       # Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
        # Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store
        #  collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, 
        # all with different qualities and usage.

     # A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.


# s = {12,35,45,56,25}
# s.add(60) # to insert in set
# s.discard(12)  # remove item from set
# s.clear() # clear all elements 
# print(s)



# p = {1,2,3}
# q = {3,4,5}
# print(p.union(q)) # add both set 
# print(p.intersection(q))   # common 
# print(p.difference(q))   # difference

# print(p|q)
# print(p&q)
# print(p-q)


           
                     # Real-life example of set is :
                #   like we have to count the visitors that are visited to 
                #  the site
